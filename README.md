# Analysis-of-Olympic-Medal-Trends
📊 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Tableau dashboard built using more than a century of Olympic medal data from 1896 to 2008. The goal is to transform raw historical records of Summer Olympic medalists into an interactive, visually compelling analytical tool.

The dashboard allows users to explore how medal achievements have evolved across different countries, sports, disciplines, genders, and Olympic editions. It also highlights long-term patterns such as dominance of specific nations, rise of new sports, and shifting gender participation trends.

By combining multiple charts and parameter-driven filters, this project delivers a flexible and intuitive interface for discovering insights from Olympic history. Whether you want to analyse country performance, track medal trends over time, or explore sport-specific medal distributions, the dashboard provides a clear, user-friendly way to investigate the data.

🎯 Objectives

Project Objectives

To analyse Olympic medal performance across all Summer Games from 1896 to 2008.

To identify top-performing countries, sports, disciplines, events, and gender trends.

To understand how medal distribution changes over time, across editions and host cities.

To create a fully interactive Tableau dashboard that allows users to explore medals by:

Country

Sport / Discipline

Event Gender

Athlete Gender

Edition (year)

To provide a clean, analytical visual summary that can be used for research, presentations, or portfolio work.

To allow end-users to filter data dynamically using Tableau parameters (e.g., Top N countries, year range slider).

 Strategic RecommendationZ
! Investment Strategy for Countries 
 Prioritize training in high-medal-density sports (e.g., Swimming, Track & Field). Analyze cost-per-medal
metrics to optimize ROIE
 Gender Equity Roadmap 
 IOC should continue enforcing minimum gender participation quotas and promoting women's events
globallyE
 Talent Identification Models 
 Build athlete prediction models using repeat performer patterns to optimize early-stage talent pipelinesE
 Sporting Evolution Monitoring 
 Conduct separate trend tracking for newly added Olympic sports to monitor disruption to legacy patterns.
