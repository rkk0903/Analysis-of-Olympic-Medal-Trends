# Analysis-of-Olympic-Medal-Trends
📊 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Tableau dashboard built using more than a century of Olympic medal data from 1896 to 2008. The goal is to transform raw historical records of Summer Olympic medalists into an interactive, visually compelling analytical tool.

The dashboard allows users to explore how medal achievements have evolved across different countries, sports, disciplines, genders, and Olympic editions. It also highlights long-term patterns such as dominance of specific nations, rise of new sports, and shifting gender participation trends.

By combining multiple charts and parameter-driven filters, this project delivers a flexible and intuitive interface for discovering insights from Olympic history. Whether you want to analyse country performance, track medal trends over time, or explore sport-specific medal distributions, the dashboard provides a clear, user-friendly way to investigate the data.
